      <p className="mb-6">
        TireBuddy started with one simple idea — changing your tires shouldn’t be a whole day’s project.
        We’ve all been there: loading heavy tires into the car, waiting in line at a shop, and losing hours
        over something that takes minutes to do right.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Out of that frustration, TireBuddy was born — a mobile tire-change service built around convenience and trust.
        You call, we come to you, get the job done fast, and you get on with your day. No lines, no hassle, no wasted time.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        We’re proudly based in Ontario and serve our local communities with an honest, straightforward approach.
        Being a small, owner-operated business means you’re dealing directly with someone who cares about doing things right —
        showing up on time, being friendly, and treating every customer like a neighbour.
      </p>
      <p className="italic">
        At TireBuddy, our goal isn’t just to change tires — it’s to make life easier for drivers across Ontario, one driveway at a time.
