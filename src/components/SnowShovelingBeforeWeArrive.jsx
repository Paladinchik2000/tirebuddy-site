            Snow happens fast in Ontario — but your day doesn’t have to stop
            because of it. When TireBuddy comes to clear your snow, our goal is
            simple: <strong>make your driveway safe, clean, and usable</strong>{" "}
            as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            The good news? There’s not much you need to do before we arrive.
            But a few small preparations can make a big difference — they help
            us work faster, safer, and more efficiently, so you get the best
            result for your home.

                1. Move Cars If Possible
              </h2>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                If you can, try to{" "}
                <strong>move your vehicles off the driveway</strong> before we
                arrive — even if it’s just onto the street or slightly to the

                This lets us clear the full surface of your driveway, avoid snow

                faster.

                2. Open Any Gates or Access Points
              </h2>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                If you’d like us to clear your backyard, side path, or walkway,
                it really helps when gates are{" "}
                <strong>unlocked and open</strong>, and pets are safely inside.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                That way we don’t need to disturb you, and we can go straight to
                work without knocking or calling — especially early in the
                morning.

                3. Let Us Know About Cables, Hoses, or Hidden Items
              </h2>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                Snow has a sneaky way of hiding things: garden hoses, extension
                cords, decorations, toys, or tools.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                If you know there’s something under the snow in the area we’ll
                be clearing, it helps a lot if you either move it before we
                arrive or leave a short note in your booking form.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                This helps us avoid damage, keeps our tools from catching on
                anything, and lets us work smoothly and safely around your
                property.

                4. Tell Us About Any Special Areas You Care About
              </h2>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-2">
                Every home is a bit different. Some people care most about front
                steps, a path to the side door, or an extra parking spot.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                If there’s a specific area you really want cleared, just mention
                it in your booking message — we’ll always start with safety
                first and then give extra attention to the spots that matter
                most to you.

                You don’t need to start shoveling or pre-clear everything. As
                long as we can access the areas you want cleared, we’ll handle
                the heavy, frozen, piled-up snow — so you don’t have to.
